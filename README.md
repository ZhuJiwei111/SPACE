# ðŸ§¬ SPACE 

This is the official implementation of the ICML 2025 poster paper "SPACE: Your Genomic Profile Predictor is a Powerful DNA Foundation Model".

# Environment Setup

You can create a conda environment using the provided `environment.yml` file to ensure all dependencies are properly installed:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate space
```

## Dataset
We utilize the dataset from [Basenji](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/basenji_barnyard), which is originally in TensorFlow data format and requires users to pay for download costs. We have converted the data to H5 format and made it freely available for download on ðŸ¤— Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/datasets/yangyz1230/space/tree/main.

TBD: Since the dataset is very large, the upload work is still in process.

# Pre-trained Model
We have uploaded our model config and weights to ðŸ¤— Hugging Face Hub at: https://huggingface.co/yangyz1230/space.
You can easily load the pre-trained model using the following code:
```python
from model.modeling_space import Space
model_name_or_path = "yangyz1230/space"
model = Space.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path)
```

## Pre-training

You can train a SPACE model from scratch:
```
bash train.sh
```

## Downstream Tasks

We provide code for reproducing downstream tasks in the folder `experiments\`.

For example, to reproduce NT benchmark's results, you can follow these commands:
```
bash experiments/NT/expr_NT.sh
```

## Acknowledgments

Our implementation is based on [Enformer-Pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/enformer-pytorch) and [Mod-Squad](https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/mod-squad). We thank their excellent work.
