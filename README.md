This is the official implementation of the paper "SPACE: Your Genomic Profile Predictor is a Powerful DNA Foundation Model".

## Environment Setup

## Dataset

We utilize the dataset from [Basenji](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/basenji_barnyard), which is originally in TensorFlow data format and requires users to pay for download costs. We have converted the data to H5 format and made it freely available for download on Hugging Face.
